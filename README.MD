I've created a simple, responsive website using Material Design 3 principles with the following features:

Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
Google's Roboto font for a clean, modern look
Material Design color palette (purple accent colors)
Profile photo placeholder (you can replace with your actual photo)
Business information sections
Social/contact links

The design uses inline CSS for simplicity and includes:

A centered card layout
Circular profile photo
Responsive typography
Hover effects on links

Some things I added that you might find useful:

A business name/title
Multiple contact/social links
Responsive mobile design
Simple, clean Material Design aesthetic

Would you like me to modify anything about the design or add any specific details?
